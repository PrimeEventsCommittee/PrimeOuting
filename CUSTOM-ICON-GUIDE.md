# 🎨 Custom PWA Icon Setup Guide

## Your Custom Icon: PrimePWA.jpg

Great choice! Using your own custom image instead of the default Chrome icon will make your PWA look much more professional and branded.

## 📋 Steps to Use Your Custom Icon

### 1. **Generate Icons from Your Image**
Use the enhanced icon generator:

1. Open `custom-icon-generator.html` in your browser
2. It will automatically load your `PrimePWA.jpg` image
3. Your image will be processed into circular icons with brand colors
4. Click **"📥 Download All PWA Icons"** to get all sizes at once

### 2. **Icon Sizes Generated**
The generator creates these optimized sizes:
- `icon-48x48.png` - Browser favicon
- `icon-96x96.png` - Small devices, shortcuts
- `icon-144x144.png` - Windows tiles, medium devices
- `icon-192x192.png` - Android home screen (required)
- `icon-512x512.png` - Large displays, splash screens (required)

### 3. **Save Icons**
1. Download all icons from the generator
2. Save them in your `images/` folder
3. Replace any existing icon files
4. Keep the original `PrimePWA.jpg` as well

### 4. **What the Generator Does**
Your `PrimePWA.jpg` will be:

## 📂 Final File Structure

```
images/
├── PrimePWA.jpg           ← Your original image
├── icon-48x48.png         ← Generated from your image
├── icon-96x96.png         ← Generated from your image  
├── icon-144x144.png       ← Generated from your image
├── icon-192x192.png       ← Generated from your image
├── icon-512x512.png       ← Generated from your image
└── (other existing images)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Icon Not Showing:
- Clear browser cache
- Check file paths in manifest
- Verify PNG files exist and aren't corrupted

### Poor Quality:
- Re-generate from `custom-icon-generator.html`
- Ensure original `PrimePWA.jpg` is high resolution
- Check that images aren't being compressed too much

### Wrong Shape/Crop:
- The generator uses center crop by default
- If you need different cropping, edit your `PrimePWA.jpg` first
- Ensure your image is roughly square for best results

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Browser tab shows your custom icon (not generic)
- ✅ PWA install uses your branded icon
- ✅ Home screen shortcut displays your image
